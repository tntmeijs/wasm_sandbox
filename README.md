# WebAssembly sandbox
Welcome to my WebAssembly sandbox project.

This project is written using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Oh, and some Rust to add WebAssembly, obviously! ðŸ˜‰

This application showcases the insanely quick computational operations you can perform when running WebAssembly.
Just head on over to [https://tahar.dev/wasm_sandbox](https://tahar.dev/wasm_sandbox) to play around with a sample dataset.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out using the links on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/tntmeijs) or on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/tntmeijs).

Cheers!
